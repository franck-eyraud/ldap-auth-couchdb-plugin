# My First CouchDB Plugin

This is a practical guide to developing CouchDB plugins.


## Preparation

To get started, you need to install CouchDB from source, grab the CouchDB sources:

    git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/couchdb.git

Follow the instructions in `couchdb/INSTALL.Unix` and `couchdb/DEVELOPERS` to get a development environment going.

Be sure to install CouchDB into your system. If you want to install CouchDB into a development directory, make sure that the `bin/` folder of that directory is in your `PATH`.

Next, install *rebar* from <https://github.com/rebar/rebar>.
